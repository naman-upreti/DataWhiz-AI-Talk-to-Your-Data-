# DataWhiz AI – Talk to Your Data

**DataWhiz AI** is a simple, user-friendly web application that lets you **upload CSV or Excel files** and then **ask questions in plain English** about your data. The app uses AI (llm model  via LangChain) to analyze your dataset, provide summaries, and generate charts—no coding required.

---

## 📖 What Is DataWhiz AI?

Imagine having a virtual analyst who can instantly:
- Read your spreadsheet
- Answer questions like “Which product sold the most?” or “Show me monthly sales trends”
- Generate charts to visualize key insights

All you do is upload your data file and start typing. DataWhiz AI does the rest.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**  
  • React (v18+) + TypeScript  
  • Vite (fast development server)  
  • Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)  
  • Lucide React (icon library)  
  • Axios (API calls)  

- **Backend** (planned)  
  • Python (3.8+)  
  • FastAPI (high-performance API framework)  
  • Pydantic (data validation)  
  • pandas (data parsing)  
  • matplotlib / plotly (chart generation)  
  • python-dotenv (environment variables)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the frontend running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/datawhiz-ai.git
   cd datawhiz-ai/frontend
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** (optional, for future API key use)

   ```bash
   # In the frontend folder, create a file named .env
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   > For now, the app uses a **mock API**. When you add a real Python backend, update `VITE_BACKEND_URL` accordingly.

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   * Open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** (or whatever address Vite reports).

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Welcome / Quick Tour**

   * On first visit, an **Intro Page** appears, explaining how to use DataWhiz AI.
   * Click **Get Started** (or close the intro) to proceed.

2. **Upload Your Data**

   * Click the **“Upload Data”** button in the Home page.
   * Drag a CSV or Excel file into the uploader (or click to select).
   * Once uploaded, you’ll see a mock dataset ID appear (replacing with a real backend later).

3. **Ask Your Data**

   * Type natural language questions in the **chat box** (e.g., “Show me sales by region”).
   * Press **Enter** or click **Send**.
   * You’ll see an AI-generated answer appear below the chat input.

4. **View Charts & Insights**

   * If your question triggers a chart (e.g., “Plot monthly sales”), a chart appears in the **Visualization** area.
   * Currently, charts are mocked—once the Python backend is hooked up, you’ll see real plots.

5. **Dark / Light Mode**

   * Toggle the sun/moon icon in the top right of the header to switch between themes.
   * The app remembers your preference on refresh.

6. **Re-open Quick Tour**

   * Click **“DataWhiz AI”** in the header at any time to re-open the Intro Page.

## 🛠️ How to Connect a Python Backend

When you’re ready to replace the mock API with a real FastAPI backend:

1. **Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv pandas openpyxl matplotlib pydantic
   ```

3. **Write FastAPI Routes**

   * `POST /upload` to accept file uploads and return a `dataset_id`.
   * `POST /ask` to accept a question + `dataset_id` and return an answer + optional chart data.
   * `POST /chart` (if separate) to return chart images or JSON.

4. **Update Frontend API URL**

   * In `src/services/api.ts`, replace `const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5173";` with:

     ```ts
     const BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL || "http://localhost:8000";
     ```
   * If your FastAPI endpoints require an API key, add:

     ```ts
     axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}`;
     ```

5. **Run FastAPI Server**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

6. **Test the Integration**

   * Return to the frontend (`cd ../frontend`) and confirm that uploading a file and asking a question calls the real FastAPI endpoints.

## 📁 Folder-by‐Folder Walkthrough

### 1. `frontend/`

* **`src/components/`**

  * `Header.tsx` — Contains the app title, dark mode toggle, and triggers the intro page.
  * `FileUploader.tsx` — Drag-and-drop or click uploader for CSV/Excel. Calls `uploadFile` in `api.ts`.
  * `ChatWindow.tsx` — Input box for questions. Calls `askQuestion` in `api.ts`.
  * `ChartDisplay.tsx` — Shows a base64-encoded chart image returned by the backend.
  * `IntroPage.tsx` — Full-screen “Quick Tour” overlay shown on first load or when clicking the header.

* **`src/pages/Home.tsx`**

  * Main page that ties together `FileUploader`, `ChatWindow`, and `ChartDisplay`.
  * Contains placeholder handler functions (to be replaced once the backend is live).

* **`src/services/api.ts`**

  * Axios functions for `uploadFile`, `askQuestion`, and `generateChart`.
  * Comment placeholders for switching `BASE_URL` to FastAPI and adding an API key.

* **`src/types/`**

  * TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `UploadResponse`, `AskResponse`, `ChartResponse`) that define the expected shape of data returned by the backend.

* **`App.tsx`**

  * Holds top-level state: `darkMode` and `showIntro`.
  * Reads/writes `localStorage` for theme preference and whether the intro has been seen.
  * Renders `Header`, `Home`, and `IntroPage` (conditionally).

* **`main.tsx`**, **`index.css`**

  * Standard Vite entry point and global styles.
  * `tailwind.config.js` ensures dark mode is enabled via the `class` strategy.
